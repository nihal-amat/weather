# Weather Dashboard Application Report

## Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a full-stack web application that demonstrates various Python programming concepts from weeks 1-3 of a Python crash course. It integrates multiple technologies to create a functional weather application with user authentication, data visualization, and external API integration.

The application allows users to:
- Register and login to a personalized dashboard
- Search for weather information by city name
- Save favorite cities for quick access
- View their search history
- See statistical analysis of their weather searches
- Visualize temperature trends over time through charts

## Project Architecture

The Weather Dashboard follows a typical web application architecture with three main components:

1. **Backend API (FastAPI)**: Handles HTTP requests, business logic, authentication, and data persistence
2. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**: Provides user interface and client-side interactions
3. **Database (SQLite)**: Stores user data, weather history, and user preferences

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following key Python packages:

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and charting
- **Requests**: HTTP library for making API calls
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library (for potential future features)

## Detailed Analysis of app.py

The `app.py` file is the core of the application, containing all backend functionality. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Application Initialization

```python
# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI(
    title="Weather Dashboard",
    description="An end-to-end weather application demonstrating Python concepts",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Setup templates and static files
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")
security = HTTPBasic()
```

The application is built using the FastAPI framework. It configures:
- Static file serving for CSS, JavaScript, and images
- Jinja2 templating for HTML rendering
- Basic HTTP authentication for user login

### Database Setup

The application uses SQLite for data storage with three main tables:

1. **users**: Stores user credentials and account information
2. **weather_data**: Records weather searches with temperature, humidity, etc.
3. **favorites**: Tracks users' favorite cities

The database is initialized at application startup using the `init_db()` function, which creates the tables if they don't exist:

```python
def init_db():
    """Initialize the SQLite database with tables if they don't exist"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create tables (users, weather_data, favorites)
    ...
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

A sample user with username "demo" and password "password" is created for testing purposes if it doesn't already exist.

### Authentication System

The application implements a secure authentication system with:

1. **Password Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 with random salt for secure password storage
   ```python
   def get_password_hash(password: str) -> str:
       """Generate a salted SHA-256 hash for password"""
       salt = secrets.token_hex(16)
       hash_obj = hashlib.sha256(password.encode() + salt.encode())
       return f"{salt}${hash_obj.hexdigest()}"
   ```

2. **Password Verification**: Validates password against stored hash
   ```python
   def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
       """Verify a password against a salted hash"""
       if not hashed_password or "$" not in hashed_password:
           return False
       
       salt, hash_value = hashed_password.split("$", 1)
       password_hash = hashlib.sha256(plain_password.encode() + salt.encode()).hexdigest()
       return password_hash == hash_value
   ```

3. **User Authentication**: Validates HTTP Basic Auth credentials against database
   ```python
   def authenticate_user(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):
       """Authenticate a user with HTTP Basic Auth"""
       # Check credentials against database
       ...
   ```

### Weather Data Integration

The application integrates with the Open-Meteo API to fetch real weather data:

```python
def get_weather_data(city: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get weather data for a city using Open-Meteo API"""
    try:
        # First geocode the city name to get coordinates
        geocoding_url = f"https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name={city}&count=1"
        geocoding_response = requests.get(geocoding_url, verify=False)
        geocoding_data = geocoding_response.json()
        
        # Get weather data using coordinates
        ...
        
        # Process and return the weather data
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to mock data if API fails
        return get_mock_weather_data(city)
```

If the API call fails or the city isn't found, the application falls back to mock weather data for demonstration purposes.

### Data Visualization

The application generates visualizations of temperature data using Matplotlib:

```python
@app.get("/api/visualization", response_class=FileResponse)
def get_temperature_chart(days: int = 7, user=Depends(authenticate_user)):
    """Generate a visualization of temperature data over time"""
    # Get historical temperature data from database
    ...
    
    # Generate chart with matplotlib
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    ...
    
    # Save chart as an image and return it
    ...
```

This creates dynamically generated temperature trend charts based on the user's search history.

### API Endpoints

The application exposes several RESTful API endpoints:

1. **User Management**:
   - `/api/register`: Register a new user
   - `/api/login`: Authenticate a user and return user info

2. **Weather Data**:
   - `/api/weather/{city}`: Get current weather for a city
   - `/api/history`: Get user's weather search history

3. **User Preferences**:
   - `/api/favorites`: Get/add/delete favorite cities

4. **Analytics**:
   - `/api/stats`: Get statistical analysis of weather data
   - `/api/visualization`: Generate temperature chart

5. **Frontend**:
   - `/`: Serve the main HTML page

### Statistical Analysis

The application performs statistical analysis on the user's weather data:

```python
@app.get("/api/stats")
def get_stats(user=Depends(authenticate_user)):
    """Get weather statistics for the authenticated user"""
    # Query database for user's weather data
    ...
    
    # Calculate statistics (min, max, avg temperatures, most searched cities, etc.)
    ...
    
    # Return statistics to client
    ...
```

This feature demonstrates the use of data analysis techniques with Python.

## Frontend Components

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript:

1. **HTML (index.html)**: Defines the structure of the single-page application with:
   - Authentication modal for login/registration
   - Weather search interface
   - Favorites management
   - Tabbed sections for history, statistics, and visualization

2. **CSS (style.css)**: Handles styling and responsive design

3. **JavaScript (script.js)**: Manages client-side functionality:
   - User authentication and session management
   - API calls to fetch weather data
   - Dynamic UI updates
   - Tab switching
   - Favorites management
   - Chart visualization controls

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

The Weather Dashboard application showcases numerous Python programming concepts:
